Hackathon 3: Technical Workflow for Next.js Project with Sanity and API Integration

Overview

This repository outlines the workflow for a Next.js project integrating Sanity CMS and third-party APIs. The focus is on modularity, scalability, and performance optimization, aligned with principles from the GIAIC Course.

Key Features

1. Frontend

Next.js 13+ with the app directory for modern routing and rendering (SSR/ISR).

React component-based architecture.

Tailwind CSS for responsive and utility-first styling.

Optimized image handling with Next.js Image Component.

2. Backend

Sanity CMS for content management with custom schemas and GROQ queries.

API integration for fetching data from third-party services using Axios.

Incremental Static Regeneration (ISR) for dynamic and fast pre-rendering.

3. Tools and Workflow

Git/GitHub for version control.

Postman for API testing.

ESLint and Prettier for code quality.

Deployment via Vercel for frontend and Sanity Hosting for CMS.
